Extension Of
------------

Adaptive cruise control is extended to overtake the obstacle and take a shorter path while overtaking on curves. 

Project Description
-------------------

The project is aimed to build a close to real world situation where vehicles with higher speeds can safely overtake the vehicles moving ahead of them with lower speeds. The overtaking vehicle is the I-Bot and the vehicles that come on its way (with lesser and constant speed) are vehicle bots

Technologies Used
-------------------

+   Embedded C
+   MATLAB
+   Xbee
+   Specialized Hardware
+   USB Camera
   


Installation Instructions
=========================

Matlab is used to give input from camera to the bot via zigbee.
